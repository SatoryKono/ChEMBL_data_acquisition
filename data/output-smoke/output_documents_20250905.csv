CHEMBL1131738,"Rational design of N-[2-(2,5-dimethoxyphenylethyl)]-N'-[2-(5-bromopyridyl)]-thiourea (HI-236) as a potent non-nucleoside inhibitor of drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus.","The novel thiourea compound N-[2-(2,5-dimethoxyphenylethyl)]-N'-[2-(5-bromopyridyl)]-thi ourea (HI-236) targeting the non-nucleoside inhibitor (NNI) binding pocket of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) was rationally designed using a computer model of the NNI binding pocket. The NNI binding pocket model takes into consideration changes in binding pocket size, shape, and changes in residue character that result from clinically-observed NNI resistance-associated mutations of HIV RT. RT assays revealed that HI-236 was not only more potent than trovirdine, MKC-442, and AZT against the drug-sensitive HIV-1 strain HTLV(IIIB), it was also 50-100 times more effective than delavirdine or nevirapine and twice as effective as our recently reported lead compound N-[2-(2-fluorophenethyl)]-N'-[2-(5-bromopyridyl)]-thiourea (HI-240) against the NNI-resistant Y181C mutant HIV-1 strain A17. Most importantly, HI-236 was highly effective against the multidrug-resistant HIV-1 strain RT-MDR with multiple mutations involving the RT residues 74V, 41L, 106A, and 215Y. The activity of HI-236 against RT-MDR was superior to that of other anti-HIV agents tested, which are listed in the following order: HI-236 (IC50: 5 nM) > HI-240 (IC50: 6 nM) > trovirdine (IC50: 20 nM) > AZT (IC50: 150 nM) > MKC-442 (IC50: 300 nM) > delavirdine (IC50: 400 nM) > nevirapine (IC50: 5 microM).",10.1016/s0960-894x(99)00235-8,1999,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,,9,11,1593,1598,10386942,"Mao C, Sudbeck EA, Venkatachalam TK, Uckun FM.",,10386942,,"Rational design of N-[2-(2,5-dimethoxyphenylethyl)]-N'-[2-(5-bromopyridyl)]-thiourea (HI-236) as a potent non-nucleoside inhibitor of drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus.","The novel thiourea compound N-[2-(2,5-dimethoxyphenylethyl)]-N'-[2-(5-bromopyridyl)]-thi ourea (HI-236) targeting the non-nucleoside inhibitor (NNI) binding pocket of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) was rationally designed using a computer model of the NNI binding pocket.

CHEMBL1123225,Opioid agonist and antagonist bivalent ligands. The relationship between spacer length and selectivity at multiple opioid receptors.,"Bivalent ligands containing the oxymorphamine or naltrexamine pharmacophores connected to spacers of varying length were synthesized and evaluated for their selectivity at mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors. The oxymorphamine bivalent ligands (1-8) behaved as mu agonists on the electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum longitudinal muscle preparation (GPI). The spacer that conferred peak agonist activity in these series contains a total of four glycyl units (n = 2). Binding studies with guinea pig brain membranes showed a qualitatively similar profile at mu receptors as a function of spacer length. Also, delta receptor selectivity increased as the spacer was lengthened. The naltrexamine bivalent ligands (9-13) effectively antagonized the mu receptor agonist morphine in the GPI at the same optimal spacer length (n = 2) as in the agonist series. However, the peak antagonism of ethylketazocine, a kappa receptor agonist, occurred with the bivalent ligand 9 containing the shortest spacer (n = 0), and it was found that 9 is the most selective kappa antagonist in the series. While receptor binding roughly parallels that of kappa antagonist activity in the GPI, no correlation between binding and antagonist activity was observed at mu opioid receptors.

Preparation of above sulfones was achieved by reacting arylsulfonyl chlorides with substituted pyrroles and indoles or by condensing sulfonamides with 2,5-dimethoxytetrahydrofuran in glacial acetic acid according to the Clauson-Kaas method. Chemical requisites relevant to the anti-HIV-1 activity of these compounds are both a 2-sulfonyl-4-chloroanilino moiety and an alkoxycarbonyl group at position 2 of the pyrrole ring. The best activity and selectivity were obtained with ethoxycarbonyl and isopropoxycarbonyl substituents. Substitutions at the amino group of the pharmacophore moiety led to inactive products (alkylation) or weakened (acylation) anti-HIV-1 activity. Among test derivatives, 16 compounds showed EC50 values ranging between 10 and 1 microM, and five (8b',d',f',h'j') showed EC50S in the sub-micromolar range. The compounds were active against HIV-1, both wild type and AZT-resistant strains, but not against HIV-2. Moreover, in enzyme assays they potently inhibited the HIV-1 recombinant reverse transcriptase, were 10 times less active against enzymes from nevirapine- and TIBO-resistant strains, and were totally inactive against the HIV-2 recombinant enzyme.

To follow up on the novel DABO derivatives, we decided to investigate the effect of electron-withdrawing substituents in the benzyl unit of the S-DABO skeleton versus their anti-HIV-1 activity.
